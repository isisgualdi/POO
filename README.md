# Object-Oriented Programming in Java

Welcome to my first project in Java, where I dive into the fundamentals of Object-Oriented Programming (OOP). This repository is a collection of my initial experiments and learning exercises as I explore the concepts and principles of OOP.

## About the Project
In this project, I aim to:

- Understand the core principles of OOP: encapsulation, inheritance, polymorphism, and abstraction.
- Develop simple applications to solidify my grasp of OOP concepts.

## Features
- Basic examples demonstrating encapsulation, inheritance, polymorphism, and abstraction.
- Simple applications showcasing the application of OOP principles.
- Comments and documentation to explain the purpose and functionality of the code.

Contributing
I welcome any contributions or suggestions to improve my code and understanding of OOP.

Happy coding :)
